          HackPack is a web app designed for TUDev members to check out and use hardware for
          their personal software projects. The inspiration for HackPack stems from the fact
          that many students wish to engage in software development alongside hardware but
          they are not able to or do not wish to buy expensive hardware to learn these skills.
          Currently, HackPack can be found in production at
          <a href="https://hackpack.tudev.org" target="_blank">hackpack.tudev.org</a>
          and its source code is viewable at
          <a href="https://www.github.com/tudev/hackpack" target="_blank">github.com/tudev/hackpack</a>.
          HackPack was built with Python alongside
          <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a>
          for the backend,
          <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>
          as the database layer, and various frontend technologies (HTML, CSS,
          JS, Bootstrap Grid).

          The Stinger Management Platform, SMP for short, is a full stack web app and client
          script that enables the use of a suite of auditing modules for the penetration
          testing and auditing of a network of client machines. The web app allows users
          to manage machines on internal or external networks, run tests on these machines
          through pre-written modules, and view reports on the results of these modules.
          These modules are executed through a custom C2 script that is run on client machines
          and they were based on the
          <a href="#">MITRE ATT&amp;K Matrix</a>.
          The web app was built with Python alongside
          <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a>
          for the backend,
          <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>
          as the DB layer, and various frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap grid).
          The C2 script was written in Python. I developed this product whilst working as a
          Software Engineering Intern at the great company
          <a href="https://www.tbgsecurity.com" target="_blank">TBG Security</a>.

          at

          where over 100 college students from the Greater Philadelphia area
          came together to build awesome software. As a coordinator I worked on ensuring a
          successful event through various responsibilities that would frankly be too boring
          for most people to list.

          ScriptTube was a project that myself and a team of three others developed at
          <a href="https://hackny.org/hackathon/">HackNY</a>
          Spring 2017. The goal of the project was to allow people to generate annotated,
          shortened summaries of YouTube videos. What I mean by annotated is that in the
          summaries provided, links to the time in the video were provided. This means that if
          the summary of a video on rubber ducks was generated and in the summary there was a
          sentence talking about the inventor of the rubber duck, a link would be provided alongside
          this sentence which when clicked upon would bring the user to the time in the video
          that was talking about the inventor of the rubber duck. ScriptTube won Greatest Time
          Saver at HackNY Spring 2017. It was built with Python alongside
          <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>
          for the backend, and various web technologies for the frontend
          (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap grid).

          TUSec was in need of a website and I wanted to practice some of my newly learned
          web development skills so I volunteered to create this website for them. The site
          was made with various frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap). It is no longer
          in production due to the fact that TUSec was merged into TUDev but I have taken the liberty
          of hosting an archived version of the site
